# Smart Cooking

Currently we are working on developping a website allowing everyone, without requiring specialized knowledge, to share recipes, tips, and practical cooking advice.
Facilitating the achievement of a balance between health and pleasure, while respecting a limited budget, particularly suited to the needs of students.
The project started in June 2024 and we hope to release it as soon as possible.
